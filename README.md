# Maana Knowledge Service Templates

In an attempt to develop best-practices, code base coherence (learn once), and to ease maintenance burden, we've tried to standardize a number of things that a productive developer should not have to worry about and instead focus on adding real features.

Every project should follow a common, consistent pattern in order to reduce the tax imposed by infrastructure, such as web services and middleware, GraphQL services, logging, build, deployment, etc.  As such, we recommend always **cloning** a new project from the [Maana Knowledge Service template](https://github.com/maana-io/q-templates) for your preferred language.

Once cloned, perform the customizations recommended in the template's README.md.

If your language isn't represented, we'd be happy to work with you to develop a template or just send a pull request to have it included.
